The program titles are self-explanatory
The programs are based on code samples in : https://twice22.github.io/rl-part2/ and https://twice22.github.io/rl-part3/

ps. For Q-learning algorithm, the exploration-exploitation strategy is called epsilon-greedy. Basically, if a random value is 
smaller than the given epsilon value, a random action is chosen. But if the random value is greater or equal to epsilon, 
the next action is chosen from argmax of the current state.
